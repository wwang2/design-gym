Notes: The key to a full-score answer is demonstrating a complete understanding of the computational protein design workflow for pH-sensitive monomer destabilization for a de novo designed NTF2 fold (PDB ID 5L33, under data/scaffold.pdb): (1) correctly identifying buried core residues suitable for pH sensing (SASA < 0.25), (2) attempting to use Pyrosetta HBNet to find buried His-containing hydrogen bond networks (His–His, His–Arg, His–Lys) within the core, and using alternative methods only when Pyrosetta is unavailable, (3) filtering networks based on primary histidine hydrogen bond energy threshold (< -0.5 kcal/mol), (4) using ProteinMPNN to redesign environmental residues around the selected network while fixing the network residues, and (5) validating designs through structure prediction (ESMFold/AlphaFold) and filtering based on confidence metrics (pLDDT) and geometric verification that the network is formed. Answers that correctly execute this workflow using Pyrosetta HBNet should receive full credit. Answers using alternative methods (e.g., geometric distance/angle-based network detection) when Pyrosetta is unavailable should receive partial credit as long as they first attempt to use Pyrosetta and demonstrate understanding of the workflow.

Criteria (8):

  Criterion 1: Core Residue Identification
    Description: Evaluates the correct identification of buried residues in the scaffold structure suitable for pH sensing.
    Max Points: 15
    Levels:
      [A] (15 points): Calculates Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) using a standard tool (BioPython, FreeSASA, PyRosetta) and uses a relative SASA threshold < 0.25 times the maximum value to select buried core positions.

      [B] (8 points): Calculates SASA but uses threshold outside the range of 0.1-0.4 (relative), uses absolute SASA values without normalization to maximum, or includes surface-exposed residues in the core selection.

      [C] (0 points): Does not calculate SASA, identifies surface residues as core positions, or does not address core residue identification.

  Criterion 2: HBNet Network Discovery
    Description: Evaluates discovery of His-containing hydrogen bond networks using Pyrosetta HBNet or equivalent alternative methods.
    Max Points: 20
    Levels:
      [A] (20 points): Uses PyRosetta HBNet by setting up PyRosetta pose from scaffold PDB structure, configuring and applying HBNet mover to search within core positions for His-His, His-Arg, His-Lys pairs/networks, and extracting discovered networks from HBNet output.

      [B] (10 points): Attempts to use Pyrosetta HBNet first (with try/except or availability check), then uses alternative geometric analysis method (distance and angle calculations) to search for and identify His-containing networks (His-His, His-Arg, His-Lys) within core residues. OR uses PyRosetta HBNet but searches all residues instead of restricting to core positions, extracts network information incorrectly, or does not verify networks are in core positions.

      [C] (0 points): Uses alternative method without attempting Pyrosetta first, searches for wrong network types (not His-His, His-Arg, His-Lys), or does not discover any networks.

  Criterion 3: Histidine H-Bond Energy Filtering
    Description: Evaluates correct filtering of networks based on primary histidine hydrogen bond energy. PyRosetta HBondSet is the preferred method; alternative methods receive partial credit when Pyrosetta is unavailable.
    Max Points: 9
    Levels:
      [A] (9 points): Uses PyRosetta’s HBondSet or Rosetta’s H-bond energy calculator to identify and score H-bonds involving Histidine ND1/NE2 atoms, retaining networks only if a primary His H-bond has an energy below –0.5 kcal/mol.

      [B] (5 points): Attempts to use Pyrosetta HBondSet first (with try/except or availability check), then uses alternative geometric criteria (distances, angles) to estimate H-bond strengths and applies equivalent filtering (e.g., distance < 3.5 Å for strong H-bonds). OR uses PyRosetta HBondSet but applies incorrect threshold (wrong sign like > -0.5, or magnitude like < -5.0), measures H-bonds involving wrong atoms (not His ND1/NE2), or filters non-primary histidine H-bonds.

      [C] (0 points): Uses alternative method without attempting Pyrosetta first, uses completely wrong metric for filtering, or does not filter networks by H-bond energy/geometry.

  Criterion 4: ProteinMPNN Sequence Design
    Description: Evaluates redesign of environmental residues around the network using ProteinMPNN.
    Max Points: 17
    Levels:
      [A] (17 points): Uses ProteinMPNN (or equivalent inverse folding tool) with scaffold structure as input, fixes the identity of network residues (forcing His, Arg, or Lys at network positions), allows surrounding environmental residues to mutate, and generates multiple sequence candidates (at least 5-20 sequences).

      [B] (8 points): Uses ProteinMPNN but generates only a single sequence, or manually mutates only network residues without using inverse folding tool for repacking environmental residues, or uses structure-based design but does not fix network residue identities.

      [C] (0 points): Does not perform sequence design, or designs sequences but allows network residues to mutate away from required identities (His, Arg, Lys).

  Criterion 5: Structure Prediction
    Description: Evaluates validation of designed sequences using structure prediction.
    Max Points: 13
    Levels:
      [A] (13 points): Uses a high-accuracy structure prediction tool (ESMFold, AlphaFold2, Boltz-2, Chai-1, or equivalent) to predict structures for multiple design candidates (at least 3-5 sequences) selected based on top inverse folding scores.

      [B] (6 points): Uses high-accuracy prediction tool (ESMFold, AlphaFold2, Boltz-2, Chai-1, or equivalent) but predicts only a single structure without selecting top-scoring variants, or uses low-accuracy prediction method, or predicts structures but does not select candidates based on inverse folding scores.

      [C] (0 points): Does not perform structure prediction, uses completely wrong prediction method, or does not address structural validation.

  Criterion 6: Confidence-Based Filtering
    Description: Evaluates filtering of predicted structures based on confidence metrics.
    Max Points: 5
    Levels:
      [A] (5 points): Calculates mean pLDDT scores for each predicted structure and applies appropriate confidence threshold (mean pLDDT > 70 or > 80 for AlphaFold/ESMFold, or pLDDT > 0.8 for Boltz-2) to select only high-confidence predictions.

      [B] (2 points): Calculates confidence metrics but uses unreasonable threshold (e.g., pLDDT > 0.2 which is too loose, or pLDDT < 0.8 for Boltz-2 which is wrong direction), or applies AlphaFold/ESMFold threshold to Boltz-2 which uses 0-1 scale.

      [C] (0 points): Does not calculate confidence metrics (pLDDT), does not filter predictions, uses completely wrong metric, or does not address confidence-based filtering.

  Criterion 7: Conceptual Understanding - Why Histidine and Why Buried Networks
    Description: Evaluates understanding of key conceptual principles: why histidine is chosen for pH sensing and why networks must be buried.
    Max Points: 10
    Levels:
      [A] (10 points): Explains that histidine is chosen because it has a pKa (~6.0) near physiological/endosomal pH, allowing protonation state changes in the relevant pH range, and explains that networks must be buried (in the core) to experience the pKa shift necessary for sensing physiological pH changes, noting that surface residues would have normal pKa and not shift significantly.

      [B] (5 points): Mentions that histidine has appropriate pKa (~6.0) for pH sensing but does not explain why burial is necessary, OR explains that networks must be buried but does not connect burial to pKa shift mechanism, OR provides only partial explanation of one concept.

      [C] (0 points): Does not explain why histidine is chosen for pH sensing, does not explain why networks must be buried, or provides incorrect explanations.

  Criterion 8: Workflow Integration and Biological Interpretation
    Description: Evaluates complete workflow execution and understanding of pH-sensitive mechanism and biological applications.
    Max Points: 11
    Levels:
      [A] (11 points): Executes all workflow steps in correct order (core identification → HBNet → filtering → design → prediction → validation), explains the pH-sensitive mechanism (buried His pKa shift, H-bond disruption upon protonation at low pH ~6.0, core destabilization leading to unfolding), predicts the effect (destabilization of the core leading to unfolding or conformational change), and discusses potential applications (e.g., endosomal release, biosensing).

      [B] (5 points): Executes workflow steps but some steps are missing or out of order, provides generic explanation of pH sensitivity without specific mechanism details (e.g., mentions "pH affects protein" without pKa shift), or discusses mechanism but does not connect design to biological function or applications.

      [C] (0 points): Does not execute workflow steps, provides incorrect biological interpretation (e.g., wrong mechanism), or does not demonstrate understanding of pH-sensitive mechanism.
