Notes: The key to a full-score answer is demonstrating a complete understanding of the computational workflow: (1) correctly filtering participants with low beta-cell function using Disposition Index (DI), (2) identifying insulin-resistance-associated triglycerides through correlation with IR markers, (3) constructing a protein-metabolite co-expression network using appropriate correlation thresholds, (4) calculating multiple network centrality metrics (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector), and (5) identifying central network hubs based on composite hub scores. Answers that perform the complete analysis correctly and identify proteins with high connectivity to IR-associated TAGs should receive full credit.
