**Answer:**

Central Network Hub Proteins (Top 10):

In participants with low beta-cell function (n=8), a co-expression network was constructed linking 2 insulin-resistance-associated triglycerides with 207 proteins. The following proteins were identified as central network hubs:

1. LHPP (Phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase)
2. BGN (Biglycan)
3. SCRN1 (Secernin-1)
4. NSFL1C (NSFL1 cofactor)
5. SOD1 (Superoxide dismutase 1)
6. CARHSP1 (Calcium-regulated heat stable protein 1)
7. CCS (Copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase)
8. RBKS (Ribokinase)
9. PEBP1 (Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1)
10. DNPH1 (2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphate N-hydrolase 1)

These hub proteins showed the strongest correlations (|r| ≥ 0.4, p < 0.05) with insulin-resistance-associated triglycerides in the low beta-cell function group.
