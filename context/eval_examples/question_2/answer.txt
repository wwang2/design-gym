**Answer:**

Interaction Effect: -16.90 mg/dL

-High insulin resistance: Protein preload reduces peak glucose by 5.37 mg/dL less than fiber preload
-Low insulin resistance: Protein preload reduces peak glucose by 11.53 mg/dL more than fiber preload

Interpretation: The effectiveness of protein preload versus fiber preload differs by 16.90 mg/dL between insulin resistance groups, with protein showing greater benefit in individuals with low insulin resistance.
