Notes: The key to a full-score answer is demonstrating a complete understanding of the computational workflow: (1) correctly identifying potato-spikers and grape-spikers using the median threshold method on glucose peak responses, (2) performing differential abundance analysis between the two groups to identify the top 10 most differentially abundant metabolites (by p-value), (3) identifying which of the top 10 are lipid species, (4) determining the direction of abundance changes (higher/lower in which group), and (5) analyzing statistical correlations between identified lipids and metabolic phenotypes (SSPG, Hepatic IR, DI, IE) to identify mediating lipids. Answers that correctly perform the analysis and identify lipid species that statistically mediate differences in insulin resistance and beta-cell function should receive full credit.
