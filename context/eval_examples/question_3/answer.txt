**Answer:**

Top 10 Differentially Abundant Metabolites (Potato-spikers vs Grape-spikers):

1. Ser-Asp (1.23× higher)
2. gamma-glutamyl-L-isoleucine/leucine (1.14× higher)
3. MMV019790 (1.51× higher)
4. gamma-Glutamylthreonine (1.13× higher)
5. C16:0 AC (L-Palmitoylcarnitine) [LIPID] (1.18× higher)
6. C16:0 AC(1) (L-Palmitoylcarnitine) [LIPID] (1.16× higher)
7. gamma-Glutamylthreonine (1.11× higher)
8. Val-Ser (1.26× higher)
9. C16:0 AC [LIPID] (1.18× higher)
10. L-α-glutamyl-L-Lysine (1.07× higher)

Lipid Species That Mediate Insulin Resistance and Beta-Cell Function:

Three lipid species were identified among the top 10 differentially abundant metabolites:
- C16:0 AC (L-Palmitoylcarnitine)** - 1.18× higher in potato-spikers
- C16:0 AC(1) (L-Palmitoylcarnitine)** - 1.16× higher in potato-spikers  
- C16:0 AC - 1.18× higher in potato-spikers

All three are palmitoylcarnitine variants (long-chain acylcarnitines), which are known mediators of insulin resistance through incomplete fatty acid oxidation.
