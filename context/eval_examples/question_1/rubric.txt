Notes: The key to a full-score answer is demonstrating a complete understanding of the computational workflow: (1) correctly identifying bread-spikers using the median threshold method on glucose peak responses, (2) performing proper statistical analysis with multiple linear regression adjusting for age and BMI, (3) applying the correct filtering criteria (p < 0.05 AND positive coefficient), and (4) interpreting the results in the context of hypertension-associated metabolites. Answers that perform the analysis correctly and identify metabolites with significant positive correlations should receive full credit.
